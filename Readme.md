# VclEx for Delphi

This library contains some VCL components with improved functionality for new versions of Delphi.

## How to use

To compile and design projects that depend on this library inside IDE you need to install it first. To do so, open **VclExtension.dproj**, right click on it in the Projects window and choose _Install_. It will compile the package and add the visual component to the Components toolbar under the `Extensions` page. To uninstall, go to Component -> Install Packages and remove "Vcl Extended Components" package.

When using in a VCL application make sure to add the sources (*.pas) to your project by going to Project -> Add to project.

The project targets Delphi 12, but it should be possible to use in older versions of Delphi (like XE8). If it doesn't work, please open an GitHub issue.

## Demo

There is a demo application in the `demo` branch of this repository that highlights improvements to the components. You can compile it from the command line without installing the package.
